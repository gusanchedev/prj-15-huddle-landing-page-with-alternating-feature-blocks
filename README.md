## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

I learned to use FontAwesome icons with TailwindCSS:

```html
<ul
  class="flex flex-nowrap items-center justify-center space-x-4 mt-16 lg:basis-1/3 lg:mt-0"
>
  <li class="social-icon"><i class="fab fa-facebook-f"></i></li>
  <li class="social-icon"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></li>
  <li class="social-icon"><i class="fab fa-instagram"></i></li>
</ul>
```

### Continued development

Future projects will be developed using Vue.JS when interactivity must be included.
